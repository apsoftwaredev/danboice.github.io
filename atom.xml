I've been busy the past few years and have not had the time I had hoped to write blog posts.  Witnessing the miracle of evolution and creation reminds me to take a step back and wonder about it.  With this blog, I want to appreciate and notice how things can slowly adapt to changing environments and situations and can evolve in perfectly marvelous ways to fill their little spaces and roles in the ecosystem.  Every day I see stuff all around me that seems magical and wondrous like this and it defies belief. I intend to draw attention to our ability to adapt and evolve in various ways every day in little ways as individuals and as a species. Each of us is doing some little wiggle in some larger system and the Geist of our world and times includes every conscious living thing. So I'll will just wiggle and waggle here a little bit.</p><center> <div class="fb-video" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/proyecto.liber/videos/444285955983107/" data-width="500" data-show-text="false"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/proyecto.liber/videos/444285955983107/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/proyecto.liber/videos/444285955983107/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INSECTICON - Los verdaderos Transformers</a><p>INSECTICON - Los verdaderos Transformers Increíbles imagenes de insectos antes de emprender vuelo captadas por el camarógrafo aficionado de la vida silvestre Fumihiko Hirai Fumihiko Hirai fb.com/fumihiko.hirai.9</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/proyecto.liber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liber</a> on Wednesday, July 18, 2018</blockquote></div></center></div></div><div style="font-size: 14px;padding: 5px;line-height: 20px;border: 1px solid;text-align:center"> - Link last updated here 2018-12-08 Sat 15:27.
