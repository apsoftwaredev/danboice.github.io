      &lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m sitting by myself on a deck in the woods in Northern Arizona. A few moments ago I was reading about spirals on my phone after looking at some pictures possibly created by the debris of smashed atomic partials. It is about 20 to 25 minutes past midnight Wednesday, July 13th, 2016. I am far away from any nearby city with lights and the moon isn&#39;t out yet, so I can see stars very bright and clear twinkling slowly in the blackness of outer space above me. There are bats fluttering around in the night chasing bugs. The wind is blowing gently in the pine trees and on my skin. It is chilly and I shiver a little when a moist breeze blows lightly by my skin, giving me a small flush of goosebumps then fading away. Little insects are tapping the screen behind me and there is a steady rhythm of crickets chirping all around me out in the forest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I almost died a few weeks ago and I am recovering from a major abdominal surgery.  I came back from the dead and now I&#39;m out here in the forest at night far away from everyone. What really matters anyway? Am I just a bag of molecules?  If so, then it is strange that they do this sort of thing.  And now I just let that stew, thinking about how clueless I am about this whole thing&amp;#x2026; That could have been it. It&#39;s beautiful anyway whatever it is.  I&#39;m suddenly overwhelmed with gratitude and appreciation for it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a soft immediate slowly building response in my body awareness field that feels breathtaking. It is a bit like the chills or goosebumps, but more delicate and internal, as if something were in my head with me quietly observing and listening. It is that gentle tingly feeling in my body awareness.  Maybe that&#39;s what they are referring to when they talk about call Qi or perhaps a &quot;Holy Ghost.&quot; I&#39;m not sure. I have felt it before.  It does appear every so often when I&#39;m moved or ponder about certain things in times like these. It seems to like and respond to different thoughts and observations. It is very pleasant. Maybe just my unconscious mind playing tricks with me or something.. Or something else.  I really don&#39;t know, but it is nice. I&#39;ll keep an open mind about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Thanks For Visiting My New Website!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve been playing around with the blog idea for while, setting it up, and testing different generators and editors. I finally settled on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt; blog with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Next theme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; for my editor.I write the post in &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Org mode&lt;/a&gt;, which the generator renders as HTML when I export it into hexo. So far I am happy with it. I had a little difficulty getting citations to export into HTML correctly, which led me on a small excursion, but I think I can just edit the HTML to have the correct in-text citations for now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now for the writing! For this blog, I plan to write about my experiences providing philosophical counseling and helping people with trance/hypnosis/spirituality/meditation over the past few years. I also plan to write about topics that I&#39;m currently researching or reflecting on â€“ usually things related to philosophy, psychology, politics, culture, personal experiences and other interests. I may repost some of my old articles and papers. When I finish reading an article or a book, I may post a short review or some reflections about it. This will be a casual blog with open discussion about anything. If you have any ideas for things you would like to see discussed, please feel free to post the ideas and questions in the comment sections.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The style for the comments is Internet casual conversational; however, please be polite and constructive when discussing topics with others.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for checking it out. I hope you find something to enjoy. I&#39;ll probably keep tweaking the website for a while, but I hope to have a new post every month or so.  You can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://adaptivephilosophy.io/about/&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; section for short bio of my adult career and education.
