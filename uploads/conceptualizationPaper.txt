@article{parentchild,
	Abstract = {Evaluated the effectiveness of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for 24 mother-child dyads. Families received 14 weekly sessions of PCIT, with half receiving Child-Directed Interaction training first (CDI-First group) and half receiving Parent-Directed Interaction training first (PDI-First group). At midtreatment, the PDI training stage was more effective than the CDI stage for reducing noncompliance and disruptiveness. The groups were also compared at posttreatment to examine the impact of stage sequence. The PDI-First group was more improved on parent report of conduct problems, and mothers were more satisfied with therapy. The two groups were combined to examine overall treatment outcome. Families moved from outside normal limits to within normal limits on compliance, conduct problems, activity level, and maternal stress, and showed improvement in internalizing problems and child self-esteem. Gains were maintained at 6-week follow-up. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{relational2011,
	Abstract = {The goal of this study is to analyze preferences for relational styles in encounters with mental health providers across racial and ethnic groups. Four primary themes describe what patients want from a mental health provider: listening, understanding, spending time, and managing differences. However, using contextual comparative analysis, the findings explicate how these themes are described differently across African Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites, uncovering important qualitative differences in the meaning of these themes across the groups. The article suggests that closer attention to qualitative preferences for style of interaction with providers may help address disparities in mental health care for racial and ethnic minorities. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Randomly selected videotapes of 109 MDFP sessions, 57 MDFT sessions, and 31 CBT sessions were observationally rated along two key dimensions of implementation: intervention parameters and intervention techniques. Overall, MDFP was similar to MDFT and different from CBT in a manner congruent with its theoretical principles of interactional, systemic intervention. However, deficiencies in parental monitoring and developmental knowledge interventions point the way for continued model development.

Given the overall scarcity of literature specific to this unique group, models of identity formation for a broader category (i.e., multi-racial youth) are presented and critiqued in terms of their application to L/AA adolescent. Special identity-related factors for L/AA youth populations are presented including the race of the youth's Latino parent, the L/AA youth's appearance, acceptance from family members and peers, and cultural conflict within the home. Guided by Sue and Sue (2003), specific suggestions for culturally competent family therapy are provided, and detailed using a case vignette. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
